## Running the TUI  


## Running the GUI
To run the GUI, run the following from the root of the repository:

python3 src/gui.py

The GUI displays the current state of the board. To move a piece, the current and selected piece's valid moves will be highlighted, and the player can select where they want to move (out of the valid moves).

Like the TUI, you can play against a bot, or have two bots play against each other.
